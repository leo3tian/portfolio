# EcoTrack: AI-Powered Carbon Footprint Tracker

**üèÜ 1st Place Winner - HackTheClimate 2024**

A mobile application that uses AI to automatically track and analyze users' carbon footprints through receipt scanning and lifestyle data.

## The Challenge

At HackTheClimate 2024, our team was tasked with creating technology solutions for climate action. We identified that while many people want to reduce their carbon footprint, they lack:

- Easy ways to track their actual impact
- Personalized, actionable insights
- Motivation to maintain sustainable habits

## Our Solution

EcoTrack makes carbon footprint tracking effortless by combining AI-powered receipt scanning with intelligent lifestyle analysis.

### Key Features

#### Smart Receipt Scanning
- Snap photos of receipts to automatically log purchases
- AI extracts product information and calculates carbon impact
- Supports receipts from 500+ major retailers

#### Intelligent Categorization
- Machine learning categorizes purchases (food, transport, clothing, etc.)
- Tracks carbon impact across different lifestyle categories
- Provides detailed breakdowns and trends

#### Personalized Insights
- AI-generated recommendations for reducing carbon footprint
- Weekly reports with actionable sustainability tips
- Comparison with similar users (anonymized)

#### Gamification & Social Features
- Achievement system for reaching sustainability goals
- Challenge friends to carbon-reduction competitions
- Community sharing of eco-friendly tips and wins

## Technical Architecture

### Mobile App (React Native)
- Cross-platform app for iOS and Android
- Camera integration for receipt scanning
- Offline-first architecture with sync capabilities

### AI Backend (Python + FastAPI)
- OpenAI Vision API for receipt text extraction
- Custom ML models for carbon footprint calculation
- Real-time data processing pipeline

### Database & Auth (Firebase)
- User authentication and profile management
- Real-time data synchronization
- Secure storage of personal consumption data

## Development Process

### Day 1: Research & Planning
- Conducted user interviews with 20+ sustainability-conscious individuals
