# AI Voice Agent Platform - Ultravox AI

During my internship at Ultravox AI, I worked on cutting-edge voice AI technology that enables real-time conversations between humans and AI agents.

## What I Built

### Real-time Voice Processing Pipeline
- Implemented low-latency audio processing systems using WebRTC
- Optimized voice-to-text and text-to-voice conversion pipelines
- Reduced conversation latency by 40% through buffer optimization

### Frontend Voice Interface
- Built React components for seamless voice interactions
- Integrated real-time audio visualization and status indicators
- Created responsive UI that works across desktop and mobile devices

### API Integration Layer
- Developed Node.js services to handle voice session management
- Implemented secure authentication and session persistence
- Built RESTful APIs for call creation and management

## Key Achievements

- **Performance**: Reduced average response time from 800ms to 480ms
- **Scalability**: Helped system handle 10x more concurrent calls
- **User Experience**: Implemented intuitive voice controls and feedback

## Technologies Used

The project leveraged modern web technologies and AI/ML infrastructure:

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Python, WebRTC
- **AI/ML**: Custom voice models, real-time transcription
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, AWS, Redis for session management

## What I Learned

This internship gave me deep insights into:
- Real-time audio processing and optimization
- Building scalable voice AI systems
- Working with cutting-edge AI/ML technologies
- Collaborating in a fast-paced startup environment

Working at Ultravox AI exposed me to the future of human-AI interaction and gave me hands-on experience with technologies that are reshaping how we communicate with AI systems.
