# Software Engineering Intern @Ignite Robotics

I'm developing a full-stack web portal for Ignite Robotics, a nonprofit that supports middle and high school robotics teams by providing team placement, workspace access, and part ordering. Previously, the organization relied heavily on spreadsheets and manual processes to handle student signups, waivers, payments, and team assignments. My work replaces this with a centralized, secure system designed for students, parents, and administrators.

## Team Collaboration & System Architecture

I'm part of a five-person development team, each focused on different components of the platform. My primary responsibility is the Stripe integration, enabling the portal to process over $500,000 in annual transactions. I built the frontend in React.js, using Axios to connect to a shared REST API. I also led development of the payment backend, which authenticates users, retrieves assigned fees from a SQL database, processes payments through Stripe, and updates records. We worked closely to maintain consistent API design and frontend architecture across the project.

## Impact & Learning

The internship strengthened my ability to build secure, user-focused systems from scratch—spanning database design, API development, and frontend implementation—while solving real operational challenges for a community-based organization. Thank you to the team at Ignite Robotics for the opportunity!
