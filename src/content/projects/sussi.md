Our (Me and Kevin Xiao) goal for this hackathon was to:
- 1: solve a problem we've seen in our own lives
- 2: make use of LlaMa 4's new capabilities - multimodal input & long context window

We built Sussi, an AI system to solve the problem of classroom management. In the past, Kevin and I have found that schools will do anything to keep students on task - we've seen blanket bans of important websites such as YouTube and Google, and monitoring tools such as Class Policy that overwhelm teachers with information. Classrooms and teachers are in need of a tool that is intelligent and flexible.

### How does Sussi work?

Sussi captures screenshots from student screens through an on-device app and processes the images with AI. Off task students are then determined, and students who need the most help are displayed to the teacher. 

Going beyond diagnosis, Sussi also allows teachers to automate the classroom through automatic triggers. For example, when a student goes off task, Sussi may message them to get back on task. If a student is off task for more than 5 minutes, Sussi may report it to the teacher.

Sussi also keeps track of long-term insights - student focus levels over time, what students get distracted on - that can inform a teacher about what works/doesn't work, which students need the most help, and more.
