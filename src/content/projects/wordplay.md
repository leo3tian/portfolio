# Research Assistant @UW Wordplay Lab

Developed multilingual programming platform to support programming education for non-English speakers, scaling to 500+ users in under 3 months.

## Platform Development

Engineered full-stack web app using TypeScript, SvelteKit, and Firebase to enable real-time code execution. The platform allows students to learn programming concepts in their native language, removing language barriers that often prevent access to quality computer science education.

## Backend Infrastructure

Built secure, RESTful APIs with Firebase Authentication and Firestore to efficiently handle user data and session management, improving load times by 30%. The system handles real-time collaboration, code execution, and progress tracking across multiple languages and educational contexts.

## Impact & Research Contributions

The platform has demonstrated significant impact in making programming education more accessible globally. By removing language barriers, we've enabled students who previously struggled with English-based programming environments to engage more effectively with computer science concepts.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit, TypeScript, responsive web design
- **Backend**: Firebase, Firestore, REST API development  
- **Authentication**: Firebase Authentication, secure session management
- **Performance**: Real-time code execution, optimized load times
- **Research**: User studies, accessibility testing, educational impact measurement
