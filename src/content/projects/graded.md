# GradEd - CSE 12x Grading Tool Suite

GradEd is a Chrome extension I designed and built to reduce the repetitive, manual work TAs face when grading student code. I began by identifying pain points in the existing workflow—copy-pasting comments, repetitive feedback, and lack of UI support for common grading tasks. Overwhelmingly, I found that the process of copying and pasting comments was the most tedious and time-consuming part of grading.

## User Research & Product Development

I built an early prototype and demoed it to over 100 TAs in the Allen School, gathering feedback that directly shaped the product roadmap. Based on user needs, I implemented a system for importing and exporting custom annotation libraries, allowing TAs to quickly insert and reuse feedback. This enabled cross-course sharing and customization while maintaining consistency.

## Technical Implementation

Technically, GradEd is built with React.js and TypeScript, using a custom Webpack configuration to bundle the extension for Chrome. Every part of the system—from extension architecture to API compatibility—was developed from scratch and continuously refined through user feedback.

## Expanded Feature Suite

From there, I expanded GradEd into a full suite of tools, including:

- **Smart Comment Menus**: One-click deductions and common feedback
- **Code Linters**: Automatic issue detection for common programming errors
- **Annotation Groups**: Management and versioning of comment libraries
- **Clean UI Integration**: Seamlessly integrates into existing grading platform
- **Import/Export System**: Cross-course sharing and customization

## Impact

GradEd is now used by 100+ TAs, saving an estimated **$250,000+ annually** in labor by reducing grading time by ~3 hours/week per TA. It's been endorsed by professors and has become an important part in the Allen School's grading process.
